# üìù How to create README.md file beautifully?

## Introduction

This project is designed to help developers create beautiful and well-structured `README.md` files. A well-crafted README is essential for any project as it provides clear instructions, usage guidelines, and essential information to collaborators and users. This guide will walk you through the best practices for writing a comprehensive and visually appealing README, ensuring your project is easily understood and accessible to anyone who interacts with it.

### Aim

The aim of this project is to:

- Provide a simple, yet thorough guide on how to structure a `README.md` file.
- Showcase best practices for organizing project documentation effectively.
- Help developers, especially beginners, understand how to present their project in a clear and professional manner.
- Encourage better collaboration and easier onboarding for contributors and users.

### How to preview README.md file in VSCode?

- Press **`Ctrl + Shift + V`**

## **1. Titles of the Project**

Use the `#` symbol to define the main title of the project.

```markdown
# Project Title Name
```

We have six type of different headers with sizes

## secondary header (`##`)

### tertiary header (`###`)

#### fourth header (`####`)

##### fifth header (`#####`)

###### sixth header (`######`)

## 2. How to create list?

- to create like view we use `-` sign.

### Exa:

- this is list one
- this is list two

## 3. If you add tab after the header it will add tab in readme.md file as well

- this is parent list

  - this is child list one
  - this is child list two

## 4. How to create badges?

1. **Visit the following link:**

## 6. Project Folder Structure

- Use **backticks** (`` ` ``) to create a code block.
- Use **slashes** (`/`) to indicate directories.
- Use **indentation** to show nested files/folders (for example, using 2 spaces or 1 tab).
- Use **`‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ`** and **`‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ`** to indicate folder/file structure.

### Markup & Preview:

```

project-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/

### Exa:

### Pre-requisites

- Git

### How to start a project?

    1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash

    ```

    2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

    cd projectName
    ```

    4. **Run the project**

### Note:

- When we are showing only code use ```

- when we are showing bash code we have to add **bash** after the first(initial) three tilt sign. ```bash
